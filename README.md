Here's a familiar dreaded scenario for those with young children and dogs: when baby is asleep, the pizza you've ordered arrives. Delivery rings the doorbell, prompting your dog to bark hysterically. Baby wakes up and can't fall asleep for the next 2 hours, and neither can you have your pizza meal!

Worry not, you can use this doorbell hack to send push notifications silently to your mobile phone when there's someone at the door!
